Files the subfolders:

- All the histogram plots

- The parameters used to run the simulation

- The console output for the run

- The frames 0 and 1

- The tree subfolder: contains frames 695-710, when the bird basses behind the tree

- The outlier subfolder: 
	- Neff: some frames whith multiple outlier, all undetected
	- Threshold: multiple outlier, first detected second not (it is very close to be correct)
	- No Detection: outlier, of course neglected, the pf takes many frames to converge back

- The teleport subfolder: contains frames 580-595, when the bird teleports from right to left with no
invalid measurement in between. Please note that threshold diverges, the other two recover. I added also
frame 609 to show that even after a few other frame threshold is not recovered yet, while the other two
are almost perfect.
